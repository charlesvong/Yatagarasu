# Yatagarasu: The Three Legged Crow
Take control of a group of vigilantes named the Yatagarasu. Having given powers by the japanese deity of the same name. Their goal is to administer divine judgement by apprehending criminal targets when society fails to do so.

Their current target is the leader of an yakuza gang that has been terrorizing the local area of Shinjuku, Tokyo from behind the scenes over the last few years. The leader happens to be holding a masquerade party as a housewarming party of sorts for the new mansion they just bought. It is up to the Yatagarasu to infiltrate the party and uncover the true identity of the yakuza leader.
  
**Gameplay**

Yatagarasu: The Three Legged Crow is a 3 player co-op mystery game in similar style to the popular board games "Guess Who" and "Cluedo". Players take control of the team members of the Yatagarasu, Violet, Rook and Raven, and must gather clues from the local guests and residents of the masquerade party in order figure out who the leader is... before time runs out.

There are a total of 3 different NPC types that populate the level. _Guests_, _Waiters_, and _Guards_. Each of the characters have a certain affinity pertaining to each of these types, giving each of them a unique role in the team. The affinities are listed as follows

- Violet -> Guests
- Rook -> Waiters
- Raven -> Guards

Once players have gathered enough hints and have made a decision on who the target is. They can choose to **accuse** that target. If they manage to choose correctly then they win. However, failing to do so will result in the player accusing being caught, removing them from the game henceforth. If all three players fail to accuse the target correctly, then they will lose and must try again.
